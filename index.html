            <h2>About this Website</h2>
            <p>This website is here to teach beginners about how to throw javelin and help you get a head start 
            on the competition.</p>
                <div id="how-to-start">
            <h2>How to start!</h2>
            <p>Throwing javelin is about distance, but, in this case, distance and strength are not coorelated.
             Javelin is all about form, and how much of your body is used to throw. 
            </p>

            <div id="Key-Parts">
         <h2>Key Parts</h2>
         <p>There are three key parts of throwing javelin well:</p>
         <ol>
            <strong>
             <li><a href="#Run-up" class="in">Run Up</a></li>
             <li><a href="#Plant" class="in">Planting your Foot</a></li>
             <li><a href="#Release" class="in">Release</a></li>
            </strong>
         </ol>
            </div>
        
         <div id="Run-up" class="description">
             <h3 >The Run Up</h3>
             <p>In this piece you want to be gaining speed, which builds 
                  up the momentum that will be going into your javelin. You want to start by
                  starting going into a sprint and once you've reached a good speed,
                  start to cross you're feet, in order to keep up you're speed, and
                  turn sideways in order to be in an optimal position to release the javelin. </p>

         </div>

         <div id="Plant" class="description">
             <h3 >The Foot Plant</h3>
             <p>After you've built up enough speed and turned sideways, you'll want to plant you're front heel into the ground, and use your whole body to throw the javelin.
                You're body should be like a whip, starting with hip rotation, twisting the torso, and shooting you're hand out, in order to gain the maximum distance that you can.</p>

         </div>

         <div id="Release" class="description">
             <h3 >The Release</h3>
                <p>As you throw the javelin, you want the javelin to be at a thirty degree angle, and thrown in a straight line. There's no real trick to this,
                   other than just making sure your wrist stays under control, and holding it at the right angle when you start your run-up.</p>
